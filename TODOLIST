Ideas:
- a movement mode (toggled by some modifier) in which moving the piece pushes other pieces away
- rubberband selection
- cooperative multiplayer (MPX support?)
- baskets as a way to organise the puzzling action

Mid-term todos:
- interface for puzzle feeds (aka non-library ListCollection instances)
- sound notification for events: puzzle started, puzzle finished, pieces snapped
- timer mode / highscores
- re-think zooming (100% in the center of the zoom level slider, increase scene rect on the go)
- piece sorting

Short-term todos:
- use right mouse button for viewport movement even if table is obscured by pieces
- simplify/streamline the texture selection
- kbuildsycoca4 stuff
- nice victory animation

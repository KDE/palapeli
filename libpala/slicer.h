	 * This class represents a slicing algorithm. It has to be subclassed by slicing plugin developers. Subclasses need to implement
	 * \li the constructor (where the slicer's properties and, if used, the modes have to be instantiated)
	 * \li the run() method (where the actual slicing is performed).
	 *
	 * Additionally, the class must be flagged as entry point into the plugin, with the following code:
\code
class MySlicer : public Pala::Slicer { ... };

#include <KPluginFactory>
#include <KPluginLoader>

K_PLUGIN_FACTORY(MySlicerFactory, registerPlugin<MySlicer>();)
K_EXPORT_PLUGIN(MySlicerFactory("myslicer"))
\endcode
	 * In the last line, put inside the string literal the file name of the plugin library (e.g. \a myslicer is the name for a library  \a libmyslicer.so on unixoid systems, or \a myslicer.dll on Windows systems).

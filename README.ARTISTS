Whenever you add or modify puzzles, do the following on the console before you commit:

$ cd $WHATEVER/palapeli/puzzles/
$ bash make-puzzles.sh

This will create the puzzle files for Palapeli (file extension ".pala"). If you have added new puzzles, do not forget to add these puzzle files to your commit.

You will need:
 * KDE 4.4 development libraries
 * libpala header files
 * cmake
 * palapeli, of course.

Under (K)Ubuntu Lucid (or Karmic with backported KDE4.4) you can get those by
typing
{{{
    sudo apt-get install kdelibs5-dev libkdegames-dev cmake palapeli
}}}
into a terminal window. Under other Linux distributions the package names
probably won't be much different.

Once you have done this, you need the sources. If you do not already have them,
you can get them from
{{{
    http://code.google.com/p/palapeli-goldberg-slicer/downloads/list
}}}
(look for the latest tarball). Extract the `.tar.bz2` file with the command:
{{{
    tar xjf slicer-goldberg-x.y.tar.bz2
}}}
Change into the new directory and build:
{{{
    cd slicer-goldberg-x.y
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .
    make
}}}
If everything succeded, you can install with the commands
{{{    
    sudo make install
    kbuildsycoca4
}}}
The latter takes care that the plugin is registered and readily available after
restarting Palapeli.

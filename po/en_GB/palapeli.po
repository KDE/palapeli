"You have just created a large puzzle: Palapeli has several features to help "
"you solve it within the limited space on the desktop. They are described in "
"detail in the Palapeli Handbook (on the Help menu). Here are just a few "
"quick tips.\n"
"\n"
"Before beginning, it may be best not to use bevels or shadowing with large "
"puzzles (see the Settings dialog), because they make loading slower and "
"highlighting harder to see when the pieces in the view are very small.\n"
"\n"
"The first feature is the puzzle Preview (a picture of the completed puzzle) "
"and a toolbar button to turn it on or off. If you hover over it with the "
"mouse, it magnifies parts of the picture, so the window size you choose for "
"the Preview can be quite small.\n"
"\n"
"Next, there are close-up and distant views of the puzzle table, which you "
"can switch quickly by using a mouse button (default Middle-Click). In close-"
"up view, use the empty space in the scroll bars to search through the puzzle "
"pieces a 'page' at a time. You can adjust the two views by zooming in or out "
"and your changes will be remembered.\n"
"\n"
"Then there is a space on the puzzle table reserved for building up the "
"solution.\n"
"\n"
"Last but not least, there are small windows called 'holders'. They are for "
"sorting pieces into groups such as edges, sky or white house on left. You "
"can have as many holders as you like and can give them names. You should "
"already have one named 'Hand', for carrying pieces from wherever you find "
"them to the solution area.\n"
"\n"
"You use a special mouse click to transfer pieces into or out of a holder "
"(default Shift Left-Click). First make sure the holder you want to use is "
"active: it should have a blue outline. If not, click on it. To transfer "
"pieces into the holder, select them on the puzzle table then do the special "
"click to 'teleport' them into the holder. Or you can just do the special "
"click on one piece at a time.\n"
"\n"
"To transfer pieces out of a holder, make sure no pieces are selected on the "
"puzzle table, go into the holder window and select some pieces, using normal "
"Palapeli mouse operations, then go back to the puzzle table and do the "
"special click on an empty space where you want the pieces to arrive. "
"Transfer no more than a few pieces at a time, to avoid collisions of pieces "
"on the puzzle table.\n"
"\n"
"By the way, holders can do almost all the things the puzzle table and its "
"window can do, including joining pieces to build up a part of the solution."

TODO list:

Palapeli short-term goals
* resurrect the puzzle creation and import dialogs
* welcome screen and loading progress screen which replace the puzzle table (the second mainly to reduce the flicker)
* MIME integration
* a toolbar with tools like "Clear this area"

Palapeli mid-term goals
* a KPart for playing Palapeli games in Konqueror (preferably together with a really good community site for Palapeli puzzles)
* transform Preview and Minimap to on-screen widgets
* rotation of pieces (requires redesign of the game engine - Piece/Part/PieceRelation)
* GHNS support for diverse resource files and puzzle library entries

Paladesign (depends on whether Paladesign is kept at all)
* shape browser
* implementation of a corresponding Palapeli pattern
* warn before changes are discarded on closing (JJ)

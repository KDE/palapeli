Bugs
* It seems like images are not cleared from the puzzle library when they're not used anymore.

Short-term goals
* remove libpalapelibase in favor of libpala (merge most of libpalapelibase back into Palapeli)
* refactor everything

Mid-term goals
* make Preview look cooler (perhaps an on-screen overlay)
* 3D/shadow effect for pieces

Paladesign (depends on whether Paladesign is kept at all)
* shape browser
* implementation of a corresponding Palapeli pattern
* warn before changes are discarded on closing (JJ)

TODO list:

Palapeli bugs
* It seems like images are not cleared from the puzzle library when they're not used anymore.

Palapeli short-term goals
* a toolbar with tools like "Clear this area"
* export and document only the necessary interface classes

Palapeli mid-term goals
* transform Preview and Minimap to on-screen widgets
* rotation of pieces (requires redesign of the game engine - Piece/Part/PieceRelation)
* 3D/shadow effect for pieces
* puzzle area as Plasma containment

Paladesign (depends on whether Paladesign is kept at all)
* shape browser
* implementation of a corresponding Palapeli pattern
* warn before changes are discarded on closing (JJ)

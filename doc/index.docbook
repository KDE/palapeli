	<chapter id="collection">
		<title>Browsing the puzzle collection</title>
		<para>When you launch &palapeli; for the first time, your puzzle collection is preloaded with some default puzzles that come with &palapeli;. Click on one of the puzzles to immediately start playing. Playing takes place on the puzzle table; see <link linkend="puzzletable">the section after next</link> for how to use the puzzle table.</para>
		<para>Apart from selecting a puzzle, the puzzle collection can be used for the following actions:</para>
		<itemizedlist>

	<chapter id="create-puzzles">
		<title>Creating new puzzles</title>
		<para>As described in <link linkend="collection">the previous section</link>, you can create new puzzles by clicking on the <guiicon>Create new puzzle</guiicon> button on the puzzle collection.</para>
		<para>Clicking this button opens the puzzle creation dialog, which consists of three pages:</para>
		<procedure>
			<step><para>On the first page, select an image file which shall be sliced into pieces. Be sure to enter the correct metadata for the image: You should give attribution to the author of the image (&eg; the photographer or the painter); please respect the copyright of the image author.</para></step>
			<step><para>On the second page, you can select the type of pieces into which the image shall be sliced. &palapeli; comes with a collection of slicers preinstalled, but third-party slicers may also be available.</para></step>
			<step><para>On the final page of the dialog, the selected slicer can be customized &eg; by choosing a different piece count or by adjusting parameters of the piece shape. The available set of options depends which slicer has been selected.</para></step>
		</procedure>
		<para>This manual will continue to discuss the slicers which come with &palapeli;. If you have downloaded a third-party slicer plugin for &palapeli;, please refer to the documentation of this plugin if you have trouble installing or using it on your system.</para>
		<sect1 id="psc">
			<title>&psc;</title>
			<para>The &psc; produces realistical jigsaw pieces with various basic patterns:</para>
			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Rectangular grid</term>
					<listitem><para>Contains the well-known rectangular pieces.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Cairo grid</term>
					<listitem><para>With its pentagonal pieces and unequal edge angles, it's rather hard to puzzle because the pieces fit together in an unfamiliar manner.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Hexagonal grid</term>
					<listitem><para>Produces hexagonal pieces, arranged like honeycomb cells.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Rotrex grid</term>
					<listitem><para>Through a special composition of triangular, hexagonal and rectangular pieces, the pieces form a pattern resembling to many intersecting circles.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Irregular grid</term>
					<listitem><para>This grid is available only if you have installed <application>qvoronoi</application> from the <ulink url="http://www.qhull.org"><application>qhull</application> package</ulink>. <application>qvoronoi</application> is used to calculate irregular piece shapes from randomly placed points.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
			</variablelist>
			<para>The &psc; has various parameters which control the appearance of the piece edges, especially the plugs on them. Default settings are provided for all of these parameters. An additional preset mode is available which reduces the amount of parameters to a bare minimum. The following parameters are avialable usually:</para>
			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Approx. piece count</term>
					<listitem><para></para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Flipped edge percentage</term>
					<listitem><para>The probability for each plug to be flipped. A plug is considered flipped if it points in the opposite direction as it would in a fully regular grid. On the rectangular grid, this results in pieces with 3 or 4 plugs pointing inwards resp. outwards. Position the slider at the very left to obtain the normal fully regular grid. In the middle, plug orientation is random. At the right, the grid is fully regular again, but with an "alternate" rule. This does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean reversal of all plugs: In the alternate regular grid, for instance, each piece has four inward-pointing or four outward-pointing plugs. This setting has no effect in the irregular grid.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Edge curviness</term>
					<listitem><para>Determines how curvy the edges are, &ie; how strongly the borders dent in or bulge out. Move the slider to the very left to obtain straight edge lines (except for the plugs).</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Plug size</term>
					<listitem><para>Determines the size of the plug part of each edge. The default setting (middle position of the slider) is chosen to look like a real puzzle. The slider ranges from 50% to 150% this size, which already looks obscenely large. The program tries very hard to avoid collisions between plugs. Colliding edges are reshaped multiple times and shrinked in small steps. However there still remain cases where no solution can be found, especially for large plug sizes.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Diversity of curviness</term>
					<listitem><para>Determines how much the curviness (see above) varies between edges. Move the slider to the left to make the dents and bulges look all the same. At the right, there may occur very curvy and very straight borders.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Diversity of plug position</term>
					<listitem><para>Determines how much the position of the plug on the edge varies. At the very left, plugs are affixed to the middle of their edge.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Diversity of plugs</term>
					<listitem><para>Determines how individual the plugs look like. At the very left, plugs look all the same. At the very right, each plug will be a unique piece of art crafted especially for you.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Irr.: Diversity of piece size</term>
					<listitem><para>Only for irregular grid: Determines how the piece size varies. A very small setting means nearly no variation; crystallite-like structure arise. Higher settings produce very small and very large pieces.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Dump grid image</term>
					<listitem><para>Save an image of the grid (black edges on white background) at <filename>~/goldberg-slicer-dump.png</filename>. If a previous dump exists, it is overwritten.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>

		<sect1 id="legacy-slicers">
			<title>Legacy slicers</title>
			<para>For historical reasons, &palapeli; also includes the slicers &quot;Classic jigsaw pieces&quot; and &quot;Rectangular pieces&quot;. These slicers create simple rectangular pieces either with or without connecting plugs. Both slicers allow the piece count and the aspect ratio to be adjusted. Dragging the aspect ratio slider to the left results in tall pieces, adjusting it to the right produces wide pieces. The default selection produces approximately square pieces.</para>

		<title>Playing on the puzzle table</title>
		<screenshot><mediaobject>
			<imageobject><imagedata fileref="puzzletable1.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
			<textobject><phrase>The puzzle table (detail)</phrase></textobject>
		</mediaobject></screenshot>
		<para>The object of the game is to assemble the given pieces to an image.</para>
		<para>Pieces can be freely moved by clicking and dragging them with the &LMB;. You can select multiple pieces at once by holding &Ctrl; and clicking on them, or by dragging a rubberband around them with the &LMB;.</para>
		<para>When you put one piece near a neighboring piece, both pieces will automatically snap together (1). After having snapped together, pieces cannot be torn apart anymore. Unlike in reality, you cannot combine two pieces that are not true neighbors.</para>
		<para>The progress bar below the puzzle table indicates your progress (2). &palapeli; will automatically save your progress after every move, so you'll normally not have to bother about saving.</para>
		<para>With the mouse wheel, or with the slider at the bottom right (3), you can change the zoom level of the puzzle table view. By clicking and dragging with the &RMB;, you can move the puzzle table view.</para>
		<para>The movement of the pieces is limited by the <emphasis>puzzle table area</emphasis>. This area is represented on the puzzle table's background by a light rectangular shade. When you move pieces to the border (4) of the puzzle table area, the area will automatically expand to give you more space for moving your puzzle pieces. Near the shaded borders, the mouse cursor changes into a double-headed arrow, indicating that you can adjust the puzzle table area by clicking there and dragging with the &LMB;.</para>
		<para>You can lock the puzzle table area with the small button (5) right next to the progress bar. The shade (4) around the puzzle table will darken, and pieces will now stop to move at the edges of the puzzle table area. It is still possible to adjust the size of the puzzle table area manually.</para>
		<sect1 id="puzzletable-mouseactions">
			<title>Mouse interactions</title>
			<para>As described in the previous section, there are plenty of ways to interact with &palapeli;'s puzzle table using the mouse. You can configure freely which actions are triggered by which mouse buttons. (See <link linkend="configuration-mouseactions">Game Configuration</link> section for more information on how to configure this.) The following list summarizes all possible mouse actions:</para>

		<sect1 id="configuration-mouseactions">
			<title><guilabel>Mouse interaction</guilabel></title>
			<para>This page of the configuration dialog allows you to assign the mouse interactions described in the section <link linkend="puzzletable-mouseactions">Playing on the puzzle table</link> to different mouse buttons. The interactions are divided into those that can be assigned to mouse buttons (&eg; <action>Move viewport by dragging</action>), and those that can be assigned to the mouse wheel (&eg; <action>Scroll viewport horizontally</action>).</para>
			<sect2>
				<title><guilabel>Mouse buttons</guilabel> tab</title>
				<para>Next to the name of each interaction is a button with a picture of a computer mouse which shows the currently assigned action. You can configure the interaction by clicking on that button with the &LMB; and then with the mouse button which you want to assign to this interaction. If you hold modifier keys while clicking for the second time, the puzzle table will allow this interaction only while these modifiers are being held.</para>
				<tip><para>Instead of clicking, you can also press <keycap>Space</keycap> to assign the special <guilabel>No-Button</guilabel> to this interaction. This is only allowed if modifier keys are being held. The <guilabel>No-Button</guilabel> means that the modifier keys take the role of the mouse button: The interaction starts when the modifier keys are pressed, and stops when one of the modifier keys is released.</para></tip>
			</sect2>
			<sect2>
				<title><guilabel>Mouse wheel</guilabel> tab</title>
				<para>This tab works similar to the previous one. When the button on the right asks for input, you have to turn the mouse wheel instead of clicking a mouse button. Holding modifier keys is allowed, too, with the same consequences as in the previous case.</para>
				<tip><para>If your mouse has a bidirectional mouse wheel (as most commonly found on notebook touchpads), you can take advantage of this: The button will recognize whether you turned the mouse wheel horizontally or vertically.</para></tip>
